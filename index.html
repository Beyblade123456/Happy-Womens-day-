    <p class="content">Known as the ‘Iron Lady’, Irom Chanu Sharmila has been a symbol of undeterred will. A civil rights and political activist, and poet; she went on a hunger strike lasting 16 years, protesting against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act ordained by the Indian government, which grants the Indian armed forces unregulated powers of action. Due to the misuse of the power by the army, which resulted in civilian massacres, Irom vouched to renounce food and water, in what led to the longest hunger strike in the world.

She has been a figure of inspiration for countless young girls and women who courageously embraced the field of hardcore journalism. Over the period of her electrifying career, she has met with both appreciation as well as disapproval for her outspoken brand of journalism, but she has always risen above it to remain a mark of strength.

She is renowned for her act of planting over 8,000 banyan (Ficus) trees over her lifetime. With no formal education, she worked as a labourer in a quarry. According to reports, she began planting trees because she and her husband were unable to bear children.
